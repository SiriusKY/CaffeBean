# CaffeBean
## A deep learning framework developed by cpp - just for fun & for practice 
The implementation of this code is heavily borrowed from [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), runs only on cpu and the efficiency should be extremely low(when it's completed), help me with it if you're interested :)
